> Reading is to the mind what exercise is to your body.

Recently I have been on a series of reading, getting my hands on anything I find. No matter what I read, there’s always something new to learn. From a non reader to becoming a reader, it has shown me how a simple act of reading can help improve the various aspects of our life. To name a few, here’s how one can benefit when you crack open a book:

# Stress Reduction
No matter how much stressed you are at work or in your personal life, reading can easily melt away that stress by distraction. It transports you to another world where you don’t think about the hardships of day to day life.
Reading puts you into a good mood.


# Tranquility

Reading can bring immense inner peace. It brings an inner state of being calm. The concentration you put while reading soothes and helps remove anxiety.

# Increased Vocabulary
Reading is a workout to your brain. Whether you are scanning the book or deeply concentrating on it, you are feeding your brain something new. You can always read books to expand your mental dictionary.

> A reader lives a thousand lives before he dies. The man who never reads lives only one.

Reading encourages positive thinking, improves empathy, improves concentration and keeps the brain young. When you start to read more, you will discover more reasons to stick with it.
