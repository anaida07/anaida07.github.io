Finally, after a long awaited time, the book is here. I just completed writing a book, **Full Stack Web Development with Vue.js and Node** which talks about how we can build web applications using the technologies in MEVN stack i.e. (MongoDB, Express.js, Vue.js and Node.js). More details on the book can be found here([https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/full-stack-web-development-vuejs-and-node](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/full-stack-web-development-vuejs-and-node)) in Packt Publishing.

If you are a web developer and want to try hands on building web applications learning just one programming language i.e. JavaScript, then this book is for you.

The book guides you through the technology stack called **MEVN** which just replaces the frontend layer of [Angular.js](https://angularjs.org/) from MEAN or [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) from MERN and introduces [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/).

This book guides you through building a web application with Express.js which is a Node.js framework followed by adding the database layer with MongoDB and then the frontend layer with Vue.js to create a robust application.

# Who the book is for?

This book is suitable for people who have the basic understanding of the following things:

* Knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript
* Knowledge of MVC architecture
* Knowledge of MEAN and MERN stacks is the cherry to the cake

# Key takeaways from this book
* Learn to install Node.js and other software packages required to build a full application
* Build an application using Express.js
* Create Schemas using Mongoose
* Build RESTful APIs using Express.js
* Build a Single Page Application using Vue.js and Express.js
* Learn to leverage Vuex to build complex applications
* Add test cases to improve the reliability of the application

# Sneak peek of the application
Throughout the book, we will be building a movie rating application with the following features:

* A home page that lists all the movies

![Movies List]({{ site.url }}/{{ site.movie_listing_page }})

* Ability to add movies

![Add Movies]({{ site.url }}/{{ site.add_movies }})
